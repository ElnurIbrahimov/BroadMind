# BroadMind

A neural program executor that learns to run programs through latent reasoning, wisdom distillation, adaptive compute, mixture of recursions, and elastic inference. **Not a transformer** -- it generates and executes its own internal programs at runtime.

## Latest: v0.78 (Edge Deployment)

| Version | What It Adds | Params | Accuracy |
|---|---|---|---|
| v0.74 | Wisdom distillation + Adaptive compute | 477K | 99.7% |
| v0.75 | Length generalization (sinusoidal encoding, noise injection) | ~421K | 99%+ ID, tested to 16 steps |
| v0.76 | Mixture of Recursions (adaptive inner depth per step) | ~445K | 99%+ with depth hierarchy |
| v0.77 | Elastic inference (25-100% width, 1-4 depth, auto-config) | ~447K | 100% full, 98.5% at 50% width |
| v0.78 | Edge deployment (ONNX export, INT8 quantization, benchmarks) | ~447K | INT8 within 1% of FP32 |

## What It Does

BroadMind takes a program (a sequence of operations on 3 variables) and an initial state, then predicts the final state. It does this without hardcoded rules -- it learns latent "reasoning circuits" from data.

**4 operation families (13 ops total):**

| Family | Operations | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| ACCUMULATE | ACC_X, ACC_Y, ACC_Z | Increment a variable |
| TRANSFER | TRANSFER_XY, TRANSFER_YZ, TRANSFER_ZX | Move value between variables |
| COMPARE | IF_X_GT_Y_INC_Z, ... | Conditional increment |
| DECREMENT | DEC_X, DEC_Y, DEC_Z | Decrement a variable |

Programs can mix operations from any family.

## Architecture

Seven core capabilities:

1. **Latent Program Induction** -- the model generates its own internal instructions (96-dim latent vectors) at runtime, conditioned on the current state. This is runtime program synthesis, not pattern matching.

2. **Wisdom Distillation** -- compresses many training experiences into a small "wisdom code" (48 floats) per task family. New problems get matched to the right wisdom, guiding the solver.

3. **Adaptive Compute** -- a halter network learns when computation is done. 1-step programs use 1 step; 4-step programs use 4 steps. No wasted compute.

4. **Length Generalization** (v0.75) -- sinusoidal step encodings replace learned embeddings, enabling generalization to program lengths never seen during training. Gaussian noise injection during training improves robustness.

5. **Mixture of Recursions** (v0.76) -- within each solver step, shared weights can iterate 1-4 times. A learned router selects depth based on operation complexity.

6. **Elastic Inference** (v0.77) -- one training run produces a model that runs at 25/50/75/100% width and 1-4 recursion depth. A device profiler auto-selects the largest config within a latency target. Matryoshka-style weight slicing, SwitchableLayerNorm, cascaded self-distillation, and depth distillation enable deployment from microcontrollers to full GPU.

7. **Edge Deployment** (v0.78) -- exports the trained model to ONNX with INT8 quantization for deployment on Raspberry Pi, phones, and microcontrollers. Static inference wrappers freeze dynamic control flow, weight slicing, and SwitchableLayerNorm dispatch into ONNX-compatible graphs.

```
Input: initial_state (x, y, z) + program [op1, op2, ..., opN]
                |
    [WisdomMatcher] -> select wisdom code from bank
                |
    For each step t:
        [LatentGenerator(state, op, step, wisdom)] -> latent instruction
        [RecursionRouter] -> select inner depth (1-4)  (v0.76)
        For r in range(depth):
            [LatentExecutor(state, latent, comparisons)] -> delta
            state = state + delta
        [Halter] -> should we stop?
                |
    Output: predicted final state

    At inference: DeviceProfiler selects width/depth config  (v0.77)
    Width slicing: W[:d_eff_out, :d_eff_in] for all layers
    SwitchableLayerNorm: separate stats per width config
```

## Training

8-phase curriculum (v0.77):

| Phase | What | Iterations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Solver only (no wisdom) | 2500 |
| 2 | Wisdom distillation | 1500 |
| 2b | Wisdom matcher routing | 800 |
| 3 | Halter only (solver frozen) | 1500 |
| 4 | End-to-end fine-tune (mixed_prob=0.3) | 1500 |
| 5 | Length generalization (noise injection) | 500 |
| 6 | Elastic training (width + depth, 22% depth masking) | 2500 |
| 7 | Cascaded distillation + depth distillation | 1000 |
| 8 | Recovery with width emphasis | 300 |

Phases 1-5 train the full-width model to convergence. Phases 6-8 teach the model to function at reduced width/depth while preserving full-width quality.

## Usage

```bash
# Latest (v0.78 - Edge Deployment)
pip install onnx onnxruntime
python BroadMind_v078_edge.py

# v0.77 (Elastic Inference - trains from scratch)
python BroadMind_v077_elastic.py

# v0.76 (Mixture of Recursions)
python BroadMind_v076_mor.py

# v0.75 (Length Generalization)
python BroadMind_v075_scaling.py

# v0.74 (Complete base model)
python BroadMind_v074_complete.py
```

v0.78 loads the v0.77 checkpoint (trains v0.77 first if no checkpoint exists), then exports ONNX models and INT8 quantized variants to `v078_edge_artifacts/`.

## Integration: BroadMind x Causeway

BroadMind integrates with [Causeway](https://github.com/ElnurIbrahimov/causeway), a lightweight causal counterfactual reasoning adapter for frozen Transformers. The combined system (1.3M params total) pairs BroadMind's latent program execution with Causeway's causal consequence prediction.

- **Causeway** answers: "What would change if I did X?" (structured delta vectors via Pearl's do-operator)
- **BroadMind** answers: "How do I execute this program?" (latent program induction with adaptive compute)

The integration module converts Causeway's learned causal DAG into BroadMind-compatible wisdom codes via a `CausalWisdomBridge`, then fuses causal wisdom with BroadMind's matched wisdom through a learned gate. BroadMind's solver generates latent programs that are causally informed — it knows what will change before it acts.

Bridge overhead: 60K parameters (4.6% of combined system).

See [BroadMindxCauseway](https://github.com/ElnurIbrahimov/BroadMindxCauseway) for the full integration module and documentation.
